# Mega Drive Game Demo
Nov/Dec 2024

## Introduction

Hello future! 

If you are reading this and you are not the author, that means this demo has 
piqued your interest. For that, I graciously thank you. As I write this intro,
I am in my 2nd year of my college programming diploma in Nova Scotia, Canada 
with an aim of moving to Montreal after graduation. Though my primary interest
is full stack web development, I wanted to ensure that I had some experience in
lower-level languages like C.  

This project is a demo game developed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis 
using C programming language, SGDK, and emulators BlastEm and Gens. The initial
version of the game is using premade assets but will be replaced by custom art
and sprites... eventually. 

It's a dream come true to make a side-scrolling beat 'em up!  


If you are reading this, thanks for checking it out!
